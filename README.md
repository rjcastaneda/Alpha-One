# Game Tips

For those who have never played a bullet hell game, I raised the maximum lives to 5 from 3. Why? 
Because you're in for a treat. 

Don't forget to blink, bullet hells have a lot of things happening on the screen!

The basic algorithm to beat these game types is to stay far from the enemy,
slow movement, dodge bullets, and keep shooting! 

Yes, this game is winnable. 

You have a small hitbox, but you are not immune to dying! 

If you get hit, you will lose a life, and you have a 5 second period of invincibility before 
you can get damaged again.

At the beginning of the level, you will see blue orbs with symbols 
and letters. Pick those up as quick as possible!, those are upgrades!
They're a WShoot upgrade, Attack Speed Upgrade, and a new weapon!
